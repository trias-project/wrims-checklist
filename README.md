# World Register of Introduced Marine Species (WRiMS)

## Rationale

This repository contains all issues related to the transformation of the [World Registry of Introduced Marine Species (WRiMS)](http://www.marinespecies.org/introduced/) to a [Darwin Core checklist](https://www.gbif.org/dataset-classes) that can be harvested by [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org). The transformation and publication of the dataset was perfomed by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ). The publication of the dataset is part of the [TrIAS project](http://trias-project.be).

## Published dataset

* [Dataset on the IPT]()
* [Dataset on GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/0a2eaf0c-5504-4f48-a47f-c94229029dc8)
