# World Register of Introduced Marine Species (WRIMS)

## Rationale

This repository contains the functionality to standardize the data of _[World Register of Introduced Marine Species](http://www.marinespecies.org/introduced/)_ to a [Darwin Core checklist](https://www.gbif.org/dataset-classes) dataset that can be harvested by [GBIF](http://www.gbif.org). It was developed for the [TrIAS project](http://trias-project.be).

## Workflow

source database → Darwin Core mapping SQL → generated Darwin Core files

## Published dataset
